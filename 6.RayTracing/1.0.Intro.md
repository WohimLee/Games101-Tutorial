# Intro
- Whitted-Style Ray Tracing

## Why Ray Tracing? 
光栅化的渲染有缺点
- Rasterization couldn't handle global effects well
    - (Soft) shadows
    - And especially when the light bounces more than once
- Rasterization is fast, but quality is relatively low 
    - 光栅化 Rasterization: real-time, 光线追踪 ray tracing: offline（算力提升，现在不一定）
    - $~ 10 ~K$ CPU core hours to render one frame in production
