## The Plenopitc Function 全光函数
>Gray Snapshot
$$
\boldsymbol{P}(\theta, \phi)
$$
is intensity of light
- Seen from a single view point
- At a single time
- Averaged over the wavelengths of the visible spectrum (can also do $P(x, y)$, but spherical coordinate are nicer)

&emsp;
>Color Snapshot
$$\boldsymbol{P}(\theta, \phi, \lambda)$$
is intensity of light
- Seen from a single view point
- At a single time
- As a function of wavelength
- $\lambda$: 波长


&emsp;
>A Movie
$$P(\theta, \phi, \lambda, t)$$
is intensity of light
- Seen from a single view point
- Over time
- As a function of wavelength
- $t$: 时间

&emsp;
>Holographic Movie 全息电影
$$P\left(\theta, \phi, \lambda, t, V_X, V_Y, V_Z\right)$$
is intensity of light
- Seen from ANY viewpoint
- Over time
- As a function of wavelength
- $V_X, V_Y, V_Z$: 观测位置
- Can reconstruct every possible view, at every moment, from every position, at every wavelength
- Contains every photograph, every movie, everything that anyone has ever seen! it completely captures our visual reality! Not bad for a function...
